# Learning & Memory System

Persistent memory that learns from your usage and improves over time.

## What It Remembers

1. **Successful Patterns**: Code patterns that worked well
2. **Failed Attempts**: What didn't work (avoid repeats)
3. **Preferences**: Your coding style and preferences
4. **Shortcuts**: Common solutions you like
5. **Improvements**: Performance gains achieved
6. **Agent Evolution**: How agents improved over time

## Growth Over Time

The system improves by:
- **Usage Analysis**: What patterns do you use most?
- **Feedback Learning**: Which suggestions do you accept?
- **Success Tracking**: What approaches work best?
- **Evolution**: Agents adapt and specialize

## Agent Evolution

Agents grow more capable by:
1. Learning from usage: Successful approaches remembered
2. Specialization: Developing sub-expertise areas
3. Adaptation: Adjusting to project needs
4. Collaboration: Learning from other agents

## Sub-Sub-Agent Growth

Sub-sub-agents evolve by:
- Learning when they're most useful
- Developing deeper specialization
- Inheriting successful patterns from parent
- Creating new sub-specializations as needed
