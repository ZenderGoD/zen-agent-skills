# Codebase Intelligence System

Builds and maintains a deep understanding of your codebase structure, patterns, and relationships.

## What It Does

1. **Codebase Graph**: Maps file relationships, imports/exports, dependencies
2. **Pattern Detection**: Identifies common patterns and conventions
3. **Performance Baseline**: Tracks performance metrics over time
4. **Dependency Analysis**: Maps component/module dependencies
5. **Convention Learning**: Learns project-specific patterns

## Auto-Generation

The intelligence system runs automatically:
- On first use (full scan)
- On file changes (incremental updates)
- On agent requests (on-demand analysis)
- On git commits (change tracking)

## Growth & Learning

The system improves over time by:
- Learning your coding patterns
- Building better heuristics
- Adapting to project structure
- Remembering successful optimizations
