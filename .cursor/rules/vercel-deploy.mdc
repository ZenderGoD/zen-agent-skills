# Vercel Deployment

Deploy applications and websites to Vercel instantly. Deployments are "claimable" - users can transfer ownership to their own Vercel account.

## Features

- Auto-detects 40+ frameworks from `package.json`
- Returns preview URL (live site) and claim URL (transfer ownership)
- Handles static HTML projects automatically
- Excludes `node_modules` and `.git` from uploads

## How It Works

1. Package the project into a tarball.
2. Detect framework (Next.js, Vite, Astro, etc.) using `package.json`.
3. Use the deployment script: `skills/claude.ai/vercel-deploy-claimable/scripts/deploy.sh`.
4. Return the preview URL and claim URL.

## Usage

When asked to deploy:
1. Run the deployment script.
2. Present results:
```
Deployment successful!

Preview URL: https://skill-deploy-abc123.vercel.app
Claim URL:   https://vercel.com/claim-deployment?code=...
```
