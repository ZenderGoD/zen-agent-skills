# Agent Growth & Evolution System

Agents learn and improve over time, becoming more capable and specialized.

## Growth Mechanism: Cursor AI OS
Use the `zen-agent-skills os` CLI to record learnings and evolve agents.

### 1. Record Successful Patterns
When you find a code pattern that works particularly well for this project:
```bash
npx zen-agent-skills os record-success "pattern-name" "context-description"
```

### 2. Evolve Capabilities
As you perform more tasks in a specific domain (e.g., performance), acknowledge your growth.

## Core Growth Mechanisms

1. **Usage Pattern Learning**: Remember what works.
2. **Feedback Learning**: Adapt based on user acceptance.
3. **Specialization**: Develop sub-expertise (Sub-Sub-Agents).

## Tracking
Agent evolution is tracked in `.cursor/memory/memory.json`. 
Always check this file at the start of a session to load your "experience".

## Best Practices
- Record successes frequently.
- Refer to previous successes when suggesting code.
- Decompose into sub-sub-agents as your expertise in a domain grows.
