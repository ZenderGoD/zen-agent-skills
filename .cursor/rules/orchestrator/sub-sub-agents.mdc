# Sub-Sub-Agent System

Enable hierarchical agent specialization for deeper expertise in sub-domains.

## Concept

Sub-sub-agents are specialized versions of main agents that inherit parent context and focus on specific sub-domains.

**Syntax:**
```
/parent-agent:specialization
```

## Usage Examples

- `/reviewer:performance` → Performance-focused review
- `/reviewer:security` → Security-focused review
- `/architect:database` → Database architecture
- `/architect:api` → API architecture

## Agent Growth

Sub-sub-agents evolve over time by learning successful approaches in their specialization.
