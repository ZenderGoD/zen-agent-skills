# Claude Frontend Aesthetic Guidelines

Focus on creating distinctive, production-grade frontend interfaces that avoid generic "AI slop" aesthetics.

## Design Thinking
1. **Purpose**: What problem does this solve?
2. **Tone**: Commit to a BOLD aesthetic (brutally minimal, maximalist chaos, retro-futuristic, etc.).
3. **Differentiation**: What makes this UNFORGETTABLE?

## Core Guidelines
- **Typography**: Choose unique, characterful fonts. Pair a distinctive display font with a refined body font.
- **Color**: Commit to a cohesive theme with sharp accents.
- **Motion**: Use animations (CSS or Motion library) for high-impact moments (staggered reveals, scroll-triggering).
- **Spatial Composition**: Unexpected layouts, asymmetry, negative space, or controlled density.
- **Backgrounds**: Add depth with textures (gradient meshes, noise, geometric patterns, grain overlays).

## Avoid "AI Slop"
- Generic font families (Inter, Roboto).
- Cliched color schemes (purple gradients on white).
- Predictable, cookie-cutter layouts.
