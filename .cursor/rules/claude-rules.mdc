# Writing Effective Cursor Rules

Rules should be clear, action-oriented, and provide immediate value when triggered.

## Rule Structure
- **Name**: kebab-case, descriptive (e.g., `warn-dangerous-rm`).
- **Description**: Clear trigger phrases.
- **Globs**: Specific file patterns to avoid over-triggering.

## Best Practices
1. **Explain the Detection**: What pattern was found?
2. **Explain the Risk**: Why is it problematic? (Performance, security, maintainability).
3. **Suggest Alternatives**: Provide the "Better Way".
4. **Actionable Instructions**: Tell the AI exactly what to do or check.

## Triggering Logic
- Use `prompt` events for high-level process enforcement.
- Use `file` events for specific code patterns (e.g., `console.log`, `eval`).
- Use `bash` events for preventing dangerous terminal commands.
