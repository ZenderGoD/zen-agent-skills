# 🚀 Zen Agent Skills: The Cursor AI OS

**Turn Cursor into a Collaborative, Evolving Senior Engineering Team.**

`zen-agent-skills` is more than just a collection of rules—it's a **complete operating system mod for Cursor**. It transforms your AI from a simple assistant into a team of specialized, hierarchical agents that coordinate complex tasks, learn from your project, and grow more capable over time.

## ✨ What This Package Does

This package gives you a production-grade AI infrastructure:

*   **🔄 Multi-Agent Orchestration**: Coordinate multiple agents (`/architect`, `/security`, `/reviewer`) to work together on complex workflows with automatic context sharing.
*   **🎯 Sub-Sub-Agent System**: Hierarchical specialization for deep expertise (e.g., `/reviewer:performance`, `/architect:database`).
*   **🧠 Learning & Memory**: A persistent "brain" that remembers successful patterns, project-specific preferences, and grows with every session.
*   **🗺️ Codebase Intelligence**: Automatically builds a knowledge graph of your entire codebase structure, dependencies, and patterns.
*   **🚀 Vercel Performance Pack**: 49+ rules from Vercel Engineering to eliminate waterfalls and optimize React/Next.js apps.
*   **⚡ Always-On Guidance**: 55+ Cursor Rules that automatically enforce best practices while you code.

## 🧠 Core Components of the AI OS

### 1. Multi-Agent Orchestration
Coordinate specialized experts through structured workflows.
```bash
# Complex task - orchestrator coordinates multiple agents
"Build a payment feature with authentication, database, and API"

# Orchestrator automatically plans and executes:
# /architect → /security → /reviewer → /test-runner → /verifier
```

### 2. Hierarchical Sub-Sub-Agents
Summon specialized experts within any domain for deeper analysis.
*   `/reviewer:performance` — Deep React/Next.js optimization audit.
*   `/reviewer:security` — Rigorous security vulnerability scan.
*   `/architect:database` — Data modeling and schema optimization.
*   `/architect:api` — REST/GraphQL interface design.

### 3. Learning & Evolution
Your agents get smarter the more you use them.
*   **Usage Learning**: Agents remember patterns you accept and avoid those you reject.
*   **Experience Tracking**: Agents track their "success rate" and develop project-specific expertise.
*   **Growth Path**: Agents evolve from generic assistants to specialized project experts.

## 🛠 Usage & Commands

Once installed, your agents and rules use the built-in `zen-agent-skills os` engine to power their intelligence.

### Orchestration
```bash
/orchestrator Plan a feature development workflow for "User Dashboard"
```

### Specialized Audit
```bash
/reviewer:performance Analyze this component for re-render bottlenecks
```

### Intelligence & Memory
```bash
# Agents run these automatically behind the scenes:
npx zen-agent-skills os build-graph          # Update codebase knowledge
npx zen-agent-skills os record-success "..."  # Save a project-winning pattern
```

## 📦 Quick Installation

Transform your IDE in seconds. Run this in your project root:

```bash
npx github:ZenderGoD/zen-agent-skills
```

**The installer will audit your project and let you select:**
1.  ✅ **Subagents Pack** (8 specialized agents)
2.  ✅ **Sub-Sub-Agents** (Hierarchical specialization)
3.  ✅ **Multi-Agent Orchestrator** (Workflow coordination)
4.  ✅ **Learning & Memory System** (Persistent growth)
5.  ✅ **Codebase Intelligence** (Deep structure mapping)
6.  ✅ **Performance Rules** (49+ Vercel best practices)

## 🎓 How It Works

1.  **Installation**: Files are copied to your project's `.cursor/` directory.
2.  **Triggering**: Rules (`.mdc`) trigger automatically based on file patterns (`globs`).
3.  **Specialization**: Agents (`.md`) are invoked via `/name` syntax.
4.  **Collaboration**: The Orchestrator uses YAML workflows to pass context between agents.
5.  **Persistence**: All data (memory, graph, analytics) is stored locally in your project for privacy and project-specific learning.
